# Troop 1 Hopkinton Sitewide Data Updater
Changing this will update where the troop website says the leadership name or contact information: for example the SPL name.  
It will continue to say "loading..." in the editor, but the actual site will show the right data. 
It may not show it immediately for you because of the browser cache, but if you open an incognito window by pressing cmd+shift+N on macs with Google chrome or safari and navigate to the site, the site will show the updations made to the "info.js" file.
Email the troop webmaster for access. Editing the info.js file can be tedious. Only edit the text within the quotes. Nothing else.
